            <p>As part of the Plone Conference 2014 I finally ended up with the perversion to mount a Plone site through WebDAV into another Plone site. In this a quick and dirty&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEt6ixxaORE">screencast</a>&nbsp;where you can see that it is possible to mount plone.org/events as a subfolder into a local Plone 4.3 installation with the option to navigate through the substructure and loading content like image, binary files etc. With some more further work it would be possible to render text-ish content from the remote site like news items or documents within the context of the local site.</p>

            <p>As part on my work on <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zopyx.existdb">zopyx.existdb</a>&nbsp;I made some progres towards mounting arbitrary WebDAV services into Plone. &nbsp;With only a few changes to the current zopyx.existdb codebase I was able to connect Plone with BaseX (another open-source XML database) and OwnCloud. In both cases I was able to create/remove folders and create/remove contents through Plone directly within BaseX or OwnCloud. So this solution is the best solution right for Plone to integrate with arbitrary WebDAV services.</p>

<p>While some of the charts deliver some interesting information and trends, the real valuable information can be found in the various comments left in the sections about likes and dislikes in Plone. I leave it to the community drawing their own conclusions from the numbers and comments. At least I have some more information and input for my "Why Plone will die" talk to be given at the Plone conference in Bristol in two weeks.</p>

<p>This talk will discuss our ongoing Onkopedia publishing project where we switch the customer to an XML-based publishing workflow. The basis of all publications are Word/DOCX documents that we convert to XML, store them into an XML database and generate HTML and PDF versions from XML content.</p>

<p>Where: <strong>DMS Expo 2014</strong> Stuttgart, 08.10.2014</p>

<h2 style="color:rgb(23, 51, 58)"><strong>Structured content rocks - Integration of eXist-db (XML database) with Plone</strong></h2>

<p>Structured content (XML) is widely used in the publishing industry and documentation applications. This talk will demonstrate our approach of integrating XML content with Plone in a sane way. Instead of storing XML content natively in Plone we take a different approach and integrate Plone with the open-source XML database eXist-db. eXist-db is in some ways similar to Plone and provides an hierarchy storage model, support for latest XML technology like XPath 3, XQuery and XUpdate. Plone applications can communicate with eXist-DB both through WebDAV or through the REST API of eXist-db. The integration layer is provided through a small Plone add-on zopyx.existdb that makes provides out-of-the-box traversal support from Plone to eXist-db content, a generic API approach, ACEditor integration for basic content-management from within Plone. The overall talk is driven by an ongoing publishing project where we switching from an HTML-to-PDF workflow to XML-to-PDF with Plone as integration platform (https://www.onkopedia-guidelines.info).</p>

<p>Where: <strong>Plone Conference 2014</strong>, Bristol, 27.10.2014 - 02.11.2014</p>

<h2><strong>Why Plone is going to die!</strong></h2>

<p><strong>​</strong>Plone is now more than 12 years old and has grown a lot. A burden of 300 and more modules and dependencies make the Plone programmers life a pain. My claim for this talk: Plone became with every version more unstable, more unapproachable and more unpredicatable. The whole complexity of Plone can only be managed and overseen by a small number of core developers. Even integrators with a decade of Plone experience have a hard life with Plone with every new release. My talk is the result of our 2014 Plone projects (legacy code and new projects).<br />
<br />
I will present many examples where working with Plone become a major project risk from the technical prospective, budget-wise and developer-wise. Many of the Plone APIs are inconsistent, have a major lack of error handling or expose a lot of intern functionality (like the ZCA) that show have never surfaced. This is not a rant talk but it takes a clear and provocative position against the current Plone developer team. Approachability of a programming framework (or however you would call Plone) for developers is a key feature for success. In our experience Plone is a declining CMS (like many others) - it is also declining because of its complexity and many inadequateness. This is why Plone is going to die - because it can not attract new developers in order to survive in the market.</p>

            <p>In our current Plone project we have the usecase where we need to copy over all schema-defined values of a Dexterity-based content-type to a new "empty" instance of the same type. In Archetypes the functionality would be a three-liner however the Dexterity world with schemas, behaviors etc. is much more complicated and by a magnitude less approachable. The naive approach would be to read the values directly as attributes from the original object and assign them back to the target instance like</p>

<pre>
value = source.some_field
target.some_field = value</pre>

<p>However the Plone world is bad and evil to developers and behaviors require some special attention since because every&nbsp;behavior may implement a different storage strategy under the hood that would be bypassed by direct attribute access. Instead you need to adapt the source and target instance for each field to the specific schema adapter and read/write the values from the adapter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here is the complete code how to copy over all schema-based values from a 'source' object to the 'target' object of the same class.</p>

<p>The insanity is directly visible and it is obvious that this programming approach is hard to sell as a pro-argument to non-Plone developers.&nbsp;</p>

<pre>
def clone_plone_metadata(source, target):
    """ Copy all metadata key-value pairs of the 'source'
        Dexterity content-object to 'target'.
    """

    from plone.dexterity.interfaces import IDexterityFTI
    from plone.behavior.interfaces import IBehaviorAssignable

    if not isinstance(source, target.__class__):
        raise TypeError('source and target must be the same class ({} vs {})'.format(source.__class__, target.__class__))

    schema = getUtility(IDexterityFTI, name=source.portal_type).lookupSchema()
    fields = [(schema, schema[name]) for name in schema]

    assignable = IBehaviorAssignable(source)
    for behavior in assignable.enumerateBehaviors():
        behavior_schema = behavior.interface
        for name in behavior_schema:
            fields.append((behavior_schema, behavior_schema[name]))

    for schema_adapter, field in fields:
        source_adapted = schema_adapter(source)
        target_adapted = schema_adapter(target)
        value = getattr(source_adapted, field.getName())
        if isinstance(value, str):
            value = unicode(value, 'utf-8')
        setattr(target_adapted, field.getName(), value)

            <p>EuroPython 2014 is finally over and it was a great success. We counted 1226 attendees which is an increase of more than 40 percent of the EuroPython 2013 in Florence. We received lots of positive and overwhelming feedback for organizing a full week with Python related stuff. I personally worked as head of communications since fall 2013 on EuroPython 2014. I wrote dozens of blog entries on blog.europython.eu, I was the public @europython voice on Twitter, most of the incoming helpdesk issues (more than 1200 JIRA tickets) went through my fingers and finally I worked together with Stefania Trabucchi on the automatic PDF generation for parts of the EuroPython 2014 brochure (generation of talks, speakers and schedule) and handled the setup of the EuroPython Guidebook application. I am personally very happy with the outcome of our work over the last nine months. This was really hard work with a small team, lots of ups and downs, lots of new experiences working many new people, many new challenges like dealing with upcoming shitstorm discussions (e.g. the diversity discussion around April on social media)...I learned a lot, I had fun, I had frustration but in the end we all had the same common goal: a EuroPython 2014 that would rock - and EuroPython 2014 rocked!!!</p>

<p>Organizing &nbsp;such a big conference is a huge undertaking. Several people worked partly full-time on this project (beside their usual job and business). A not so perfect role during the organization process played the EuroPython Society (EPS). &nbsp;The EPS is a non-profit society under Swedish law and is the &nbsp;holder of the „EuroPython“ trademark. The EPS holds this trademark since some weeks.</p>

<p>The goals of the EPS are according to their <a href="http://www.europython-society.org/bylaws">bylaws</a>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>2. The society is a non-profit society (ideel förening) under Swedish law. The purpose of the EP is to organise conferences centered around the programming language Python</strong></p>

<p>This is in general a very honorable goal but goals and reality are two different things. The first public discussion about problems between the Berlin organizers and the EPS popped up early 2014 with an email (<a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/europython/2014-January/008250.html">https://mail.python.org/pipermail/europython/2014-January/008250.html</a>, <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/europython/2014-January/008252.html">https://mail.python.org/pipermail/europython/2014-January/008252.html</a>) of a former EPS member which basically brought the complete situation with the EPS to the point. Although I was not directly involved with the communication between EPS and the Berlin organizers I can only summarize the behavior of the EPS &nbsp;as only-demanding, an arrogant top-down attitude and a conduct that is far away from being acceptable for an open-source community. &nbsp;Speaking of „the EPS“ as an organization is perhaps not valid because there are always persons connected with an association - approachable persons, non-approachable persons and silent persons.</p>

<p>Some weeks ago I became an official member of EPS and had the pleasure to participate in the general assembly of the EPS held during the EuroPython 2014 conference in Berlin. The first weird thing was that there was a total of 30 minutes planned for the general assembly which includes reports of the chairman, the treasurer, discharge of the board, voting of the new board and especially discussions. How strange I thought from the beginning. A typical general assembly of comparable organizations hardly take under &nbsp;90 minutes, usually even longer.</p>

<p>EPS counted 68 members at the time of the general assembly where about 30 members joined the EPS shortly before general assembly. Out of these 68 members only 14 members appeared to the general assembly including two of the five EPS board members (Fabio Pliger, Marc-André Lemburg).</p>

<p>This one hour general assembly appears in the retrospective like a bad theater piece of a provincial theater. The board was not able to give a reasonable report over the last year and always stressed out about mistakes made in the past. For example &nbsp;there are no records and protocols available of board meetings and general assemblies available for the last years - either lack of transparency or just a complete unorganized society.</p>

<p>Marc-André Lemburg was not able to give a reasonable and acceptable financial report (the slides really contained „XX Euro“). He could just give a vague estimate on the money that EPS has in the bank - not very much money as it turned out. Dear EPS, every rabbit breeders association is better organized.</p>

<p>They have five persons on the board and their only day business is to meta-organize a EuroPython conference and dealing with EuroPython trademark issues. &nbsp;The real organization work is always carried out by the local organizers.</p>

<p>What are these&nbsp;people doing? Especially when the trademark issue was the only major operation carried out over the last 12 months?</p>

<p>Then the voting for the board…too make it short: old board = new board. All members of the old board became elected as new board members. Both Fabio and Marc-André had been involved (in a good and bad way) with the Berlin organizers over the last year. All other board members (Jacob, Anton, Vicky) are not very well known in the European Python community and had been elected in absence - legal and covered by the bylaws but a slightly absurd election. I felt a bit like in the 80s with the election processes of the politbureau in communist or socialist states.</p>

<p>One might argue why I did not run myself for the board? Answer: lack of information about the EPS and their current inner state in advance, lack of knowledge about all candidates and especially where was no significant possibility for changing the power within the EPS at this point.</p>

<p>Let us talk about the „EuroPython“ trademark. The EPS claimed from the beginning of the EP14 organization that they would hold the „EuroPython“ trademark. However EPS could never provide any evidence. In fact the trademark was granted to EPS some weeks before the conference. But EPS urged the Berlin organizers &nbsp;multiple times to include the trademark claim in press releases and on EuroPython 2014 related information The conference was organized by officially under the hood of the Python Software Verband e.V. - a society under German law. And according to German law we could not support this trademark claim. However EPS always insisted on their point of view. The organizers had to comply with German law and not with Swedish law in this case.</p>

<p>Speaking of legal issues: EPS tried for the first time to regulate the relation between EPS and the local organizers with a contract. To our knowledge there had been never contracts for former EuroPython conferences in the past. To make it short: the draft of this contract had to be rejected by the organizers because it was completely one-sided. These kind of contracts can be made between businesses but not between entities of an open-source community. The cumulation of insolence was the requirement that a conference profit should be split 50:50 between EPS and local organizers but a conference loss should be carried by the organizers themselves with a maximum involvement of the EPS limited to 7.500 Euro. You could read the draft as: we do nothing and get half of the money but it is your risk if there is a loss. Fortunately EPS showed some insight during the general assembly that this contract was a mistake.</p>

<p>The new EPS approach: EPS want to take more control over the EuroPython conference organization, EPS wants to be the main contracting partner and it want the organization to be taken over by permanent teams. This is approach will never ever work out. Like with all projects: a small amount of people will be doing the major work and these people will be local organizers. It is not imaginable that other EPS member will and can spend a significant amount their personal time in leading positions dealing with local organization issues. The programm committee of EuroPython 2014 as an example was already internationally distributed organized. It did not solve the problem that the programme chair had the burden with organizing the programme. It is unlikely that the chair of EP14 would take over the responsibility for a theoratical EP15 that would not take place in Berlin. The key position of conference organization teams are time-consuming and exhausing and you do it for one or two years - especially when you take into account that many of the organizers run their own businesses. No, the workgroup approach is a nice idea but it is going to fail. There are too many local aspects in a conference organization that can not be handled by EPS or EPS workgroups. Yes, EPS wants, wants a lot...but theses are only visions and dreams that will not become reality. Life is different, EPS never organized a conference, EPS just contributed the name.</p>

<p>Talking of EPS persons: Fabio Pliger worked with the Berlin organizers in a goal-oriented and constructive way while others glazed by non-visibility or through their unacceptable arrogant attitude. My respect to Fabio for his support.</p>

<h3 style="color:#888">Conclusion</h3>

<p>The EPS is a poorly organized society with little backing by the community and not much assets. The trademark on „EuroPython“ is the only thing that the EPS has in their hands - apart from little money in the bank. EuroPython was an overwhelming success - by numbers and by feedback received by attendees. The experience with EPS tells us that nobody really needs the EPS for organizing a big Python conference in Europe. The only thing that the EPS can provide: the name „EuroPython“. But wait: did you notice our branding „EP14“. Would it be a problem for you visiting a „EP15“ conference instead of „EuroPython 2015“? Or could a similar conference be named „PyCON Europe 2015“ or „Python Europe 2015“ or something like that? You see the problem…the EPS is constructed solely around the name and their trademark „EuroPython“. &nbsp;</p>

<p>So their are obviously the following options for the future</p>

<ul>
	<li>Forget EPS and let the local communities do their own thing. EPS can only give the name „EuroPython“ but they are not able to put more effort into controlling and directing the organization of such a big conference nor they have the financial or personal resources for backing a conference themselves. The proposed workgroup model for organizing further conferences is not well thought and will never work in reality for various reasons.</li>
	<li>Let us send the current EPS board (except Fabio) into the desert and install persons as board members that are interested in one thing: organizing further great conferences with local organizers in a constructive way instead of defending their only poor assets. There is no reason why the EPS needs a big board of 5 persons. Reduce it to three board members where one member could represent the „old“ EPS and their interests, a treasurer and person representing the local organizers of the upcoming conference…something like that…I admit that this is only a rough thought…</li>
</ul>

<p>For the rescue of the EPS: it seems that the EPS got the notice and took their lessons from that what happened over the last year. The European Python community is about people and not about exercising power build on top of a trademarks and a poor standing within the community. The board mentioned that they want to held a new general assembly soon in order to fix the problems. The EPS wants to be more open and transparent. I appreciate these goals but time will tell how this will work out in reality.</p>
