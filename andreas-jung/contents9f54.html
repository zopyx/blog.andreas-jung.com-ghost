            <p>I am pleased to announce that our <a class="external-link" href="http://www.produce-and-publish.com/" target="_self" title="">Produce &amp; Publish Authoring Environment </a>for Plone is now released as open-source. The Authoring Environment has been the only commercial component of Produce &amp; Publish until today. With the ongoing work on the next generation of Produce &amp; Publish I decided to make this remaining component available to the public in addition to all other components of the Produce &amp; Publish stack that already existed in the past as open-source release. The Authoring Environment was formerly priced with 1500 €.</p>
<p>So now the complete update-to-date Produce &amp; Publish stack is available for free and as open-source:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Produce &amp; Publish Authoring Environment (zopyx.authoring)</span></li>
<li><span>Produce &amp; Publish Plone Client Connector (zopyx.smartprintng.plone)</span></li>
<li><span>Produce &amp; Publish Python Client (zopyx.smartprintng.python)</span></li>
<li><span>Low-level converter bindings (zopyx.convert2)</span></li>
</ul>
<div>The current code-base will be maintained for the mid-term future although the focus of the development is clearly on the ongoing Produce &amp; Publish work as documented and stated in former blog entries. One short time goal is to make the existing Authoring Environment working with the lastest new Produce &amp; Publish components. This includes PDF conversion support (for free) using PhantomJS (with a reduced PDF quality).</div>

            <p>I spend several hours this week during the EuroPython 2013 conference in Florence bringing the Produce &amp; Publish implementation forward.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>The Produce &amp; Publish server should be now in a stable state support both synchronous and asynchronous conversions. </span></li>
<li><span>Instead of using supervisord for controlling all processes I switched to Circus which fells more approachable and extensible.</span></li>
<li>The pp.server buildout now supports the automatic installation of all external converters (demo versions only!)</li>
<li>Support for PDF generation using PhantomJS has been added. This gives you decent PDF generation for free (including support for most CSS Paged Media extensions). PDF generation through PhantomJS should be good enough for sites that just need some kind of "good" PDF export. The feature list of PhantomJS and the quality is however clearly below the featured PrinceXML and PDFreactor converters.</li>
<li>The Python client bindings for Produce &amp; Publish have also stabilized and support both synchronous and asynchronous conversion operations.</li>

            <p>Significant progress has been made on the reimplementation of the Produce &amp; Publish Server. The Produce &amp; Publish server provides some web service API methods that all arbitrary application to convert their content to PDF through a central conversion server. The PDF generation is (as in the past) based on one of the following PDF converters:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>PrinceXML 8</span></li>
<li><span>PDFreactor 6</span></li>
<li><span>Anntennahouse Formatter V 6</span></li>
</ul>
<div>The general conversion approach remains the same:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span>all conversions are based on HTML/XML as input</span></li>
<li><span>styling is accomplished through CSS3</span></li>
</ul>
<div>The new Produce &amp; Publish Server implementation is also past as the older version on Python Pyramid and it provides its services through an XML-RPC API. Legacy support for Apache FOP, XInc and XMLMind converters have been removed (not much used, poor output quality, unmaintained). In addition the server provide conversion support using LibreOffice or OpenOffice for office format A to office format B using the Python-based wrapper <a class="external-link" href="http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/unoconv/" target="_self" title="">unoconv</a>. This API will be used later to provide a simple DOCX conversion and import functionality for the Produce &amp; Publish backend. All API methods support asynchronous processing (e.g. for larger documents). In this case the caller receives a job id that can be used to poll and download the converted document.</div>
<div></div>

<div>The Produce &amp; Publish server remains open-source (published under the GNU Public License V2).</div>

            <p>This is a personal followup on several discussions I had in personal lately with other Plone integrators and big Plone users in addition to Steve's and Eric's latest blog posts on the future of Plone (5):</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="external-link" href="http://http//www.stevemcmahon.com/steves-blog/the-plone-4-generation" target="_self" title="">Steve McMahon: The Plone 4 generation</a></li>
<li><a class="external-link" href="http://willrantforbeer.com/post/52975919723/plone-5" target="_self" title="">Eric Steele: Plone 5</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Most of us are in weird situation because we have multiple and different roles in the #Plone world: either as integrators, as contributors, as Plone users.</p>
<p>So where is my current problem?</p>
<p><span>Steve numbers clearly show a growing number of contributors. On the other hand there is the overall feeling that Plone turned into a legacy technology that will be around for many years but the overall impression is that the overall adoption of Plone is stagnating. This impression is of course subjective and based on personal experience and talks with customers. In addition many so-called Plone companies are currently making a shift by no longer focusing on Plone but also providing services in other areas and focusing on solution and services to customers and addressing their needs instead of advertising themselves as "Plone company". The concept of the "Plone company" is going to fail for most Plone shops. Customers are looking for solutions and as integrators we have to have various solution options - Plone will be one out of many others. The decade of the CMS systems is over. CMS turned into commodity software. They were something new and cool in the first decade of the millennium but nowadays web technology moved and the technology and requirements are more diverse than ever. So content management is now only a small fraction of "the web"  as it was some years ago. I think the trend of stagnation and more slowly adoption is also true for other content management systems.</span></p>
<p>Going back of the level of adoption of Plone. The level of adoption of an enterprise-level software is possibly depending  on factors like</p>
<ul>
<li><span>marketing</span></li>
<li><span>user experience</span></li>
<li><span>to a certain degree: underla</span><span>ying technolog</span><span>y</span></li>
</ul>
<div>Steve speaks in the last paragraph of his posting of a marketing problem or lack of Plone marketing in the past. I would object that this is has been a real problem and does not explain the stagnation of Plone. In Germany we found the German Zope User Group (DZUG) around 2002 and made annual conferences around Zope &amp; Plone. The DZUG invested a lot of marketing work in promoting Plone through the participation in various fairs (like Linuxtag, Froscon etc.). There was certaintly an outcome by attracting some new people and institutions to Plone but we could actually never compete with our competitors like Joomala are the special German phenomeon Typo 3.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The more important reason for the stagnation of Plone comes from my point of view from the user experience with Plone. User experience breaks down (for me) into usability of the system and professionalism and reliability of the system. At the latest conference of the  German universities using Plone we had a pretty long and controversial discussion about how a usable CMS should like editor. My conclusion from this discussion: people love or hate Plone in the same way as it is true from the usability point of view for Typo 3. Power users seem to prefer Typo 3 while more average editors prefer Plone!? Anyway...this is a never ending discussion and there is no solution to make a CMS user interface work for all editors. This will always a love-hate relationship. Another point that we have in our own hands is the reliability and the professionalism of the overall system. I personally came across several weird issues lately and bitched about them in several controversial postings on the Plone product developers list (you will find them  if you are interested :-). The key point is quality and stability. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Some examples:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span>Webdav support of Plone under Windows is fragile and not usable for enterprise-level usage. Many weird workaround exists for getting rid of webdav locking problems.</span></li>
<li><span>Customer received a Plone 4.2 buildout with a policy and theme package. Everything was working...the customer himself installed a few add-ons on its own...suddenly the complaint that TinyMCE would no longer work...even after debugging for some hours I could not find the real problem...perhaps not a core-issue but some weird interaction of Plone with some of the add-ons. Bad user experience, pissed integrator experience.</span></li>
<li><span>OOTB installation of add-ons must work. E.g. a simple functionality like video support in Plone has to work without issues by installing collective.flowplayer (4.0). As an integrator I can handle issues and properly fix them. End users just become frustrated.</span></li>
<li><span>Upgrade story: upgrades in Plone 4.x became an unpredictable pita. With 4.x update we had to update various add-ons basically because of changed imports. So some add-on in some version was only running with one particular Plone 4.x version. Having to support multiple Plone 4.x versions ended up with try..except cascades or different release branches....not nice.</span></li>
<li><span>Migration story: I upgraded a Plone 4.0 site to Plone 4.2 based on my own Produce &amp; Publish framework. Suddenly some image URLs (using plone.app.imaging) could no longer be resolved directly through restrictedTraverse() for whatever reason. In addition: Plone started to store image URLs (as edited through TinyMCE) suddenly with the full host and port which became a major pita in the context of virtual hosting and in particular in the context of having image URLs starting with https:// accessed through the public website served over http:// (IE security restrictions caused the images to appear broken). All these issues caused major user pain and trouble on our site. In the end the migration took full six working days (two days scheduled and paid, four unpaid working days on the integrator side).</span></li>
</ul>
<div>I am not sure with conclusion I should draw personally when we talk about the future of Plone. There is of course a future for Plone in certain areas like large institutions as intranet or portal but also the requirements here are shifting into a different direction ("social media"....). hm.....Plone is legacy for me...but an important legacy, one solution out of many others, a solution that fits a particular use-case: enterprise-level content-management.</div>

            <p>Historically the Plone Collective has been a collaboration spaces for open-source projects in the field of Plone. The Collective was hosted for a long time on the SVN infrastructure of the Plone Foundation. For long time this model worked sufficiently good because free source code hosting options beside Sourceforge have been rare.</p>
<p>With the rise of Github and Bitbucket and the growing popularity of GIT the Plone Collective switched to Github last year or so. </p>
<p>The question that arises nowadays: do we need the Collective as shared repository anymore?</p>
<h3 class=" ">Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li><span>Everyone can have free repositories on Github or Bitbucket.</span></li>
<li><span>Everyone can contribute to existing packages and projects by forking and sending pull requests - this is actually the same development model used in the collective.</span></li>
<li><span>The package maintainers keep full control over its own packages and sources.</span></li>
<li><span>No more unwanted or uncontrolled checkins by other persons.</span></li>
<li><span>No more arbitrary removal of packages based on constructed or pretended offense (see <a class="external-link" href="http://plone.293351.n2.nabble.com/collective-milf-tp7565302.html" target="_self" title="">here</a> for the discussion on the removal of collective.milf).</span></li>
<li><span>Your code and your repository is in the end under the control (or perhaps better: under the supervision) of the Plone Foundation.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class=" ">Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>A common shared repository for most(?) Plone add-ons gives an better overview about what packages are available.</li>
<li>Repository limits: I assume that the Plone Foundation has some agreement with Github for hosting this amount of repositories under a free plan or under special conditions. As standard Github member you are usually constrained by their free plan (which has not been a problem for me in reality - even with a larger number of repositories)</li>
</ul>
<h3 class=" ">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Every package maintainer must decide for itself which level of control over your code is better for you: I either you comply with the Plone Foundation and their views or risk the arbitrary removal of packages or just keep the code in your hand.</p>

            <p>This is a short and unsorted collection of personal wisdoms that may help you improving your day and life as a software developer, freelancer, project manager or whatever.</p>
<h3 class=" ">You first, projects second</h3>
<p>The first think that counts is you . You and your personal health should have the highest priority. Don't ruin yourself for whatever reason. Your health is your capital.</p>
<h3 class=" ">Don't be reachable at any time</h3>
<p>Whatever position you have in a project: you don't have to be reachable at any time for any person. Give your working day a structure. Consider fixed working hours that you do not exceed. </p>
<h3 class=" ">Avoid overtime</h3>
<p>Overtime is a bad thing. Yes, things must be done at some point but constant overtime is bad for your health and mood - unless you are a coding maniac. </p>
<h3 class=" ">Don't be a slave of your email client</h3>
<p>Reduce to poll time of your email client to one hour or so - being interrupted while programming is a bad thing. </p>
<h3 class=" ">Delay email replies</h3>
<p>There are email client add-ons like SendItlater that allow you to answer to an email directly but defer the delivery to a some time in the future. This may slow down email ping-pong between and your customers significantly. </p>
<h3 class=" ">Have separate email clients</h3>
<p>For some projects (with lots of email during the day and night) I use a dedicated email client that I can close at any time. I use my standard email client to keep track of my private email and other project email (where I know that there will be only a few mails per day without a big risk of trouble)</p>
<h3 class=" ">Do not respond to all email the same day</h3>
<p>If there is some email coming in the late afternoon and you can already smell the trouble by reading the sender or the subject: keep it closed and read it the other day. Do not ruin your last working hour and the rest of the day with trouble emails.</p>
<h3 class=" ">Smell the stress</h3>
<p>It takes some experiences to notice when the project stress turns against you. Stress can have various symptoms and they are very individual. Personally I notice upcoming stress situation through problems with my stomach.</p>
<h3 class=" ">Get out of the stress</h3>
<p>This is often easier said than doable in reality. But if often helps taking a break for an hour or two and doing sports. First it reduces my aggression level and gives me a more clear thought on some pending problems. Or if you can: take a day off and do something completely different.</p>
<h3 class=" ">Know your limits</h3>
<p>Know yourself! You have to know where your personal limits are and how far you can go. While we are all getting older we have to recognize that we can not handle a workload as when we were ten years younger. It does not mean that we are less efficient and effective but we deal with workloads in a different way.</p>
<p>It is you that counts, it is your health that counts. So in order to avoid a burnout: you first, projects and customers second....</p>

        <div id="parent-fieldname-text" class="plain">
            <p>In a recent posting I outlined my <a title="" href="contents/position-paper-on-produce-publish-cloud-edition-published.html" class="internal-link" target="_self">plans</a> for the next generation of the "Produce &amp; Publish Cloud Edition".</p>
<p>Over the last days I found some time prototyping the new core implementation which is basically responsible for storing editoral content and published content. A major requirement for the storage implementation is that it should be "cloud-aware". Fortunately there is a very nice Python project called <a class="external-link" href="http://pythonhosted.org/fs/" target="_self" title="">pyfilesystem</a>. pyfilesystem provides a filesystem-ish layer on top of various filesystems and cloud-ish services like</p>
<ul>
<li>Dropbox</li>
<li>Amazon S3</li>
<li>Local filesystem</li>
<li>Remote filesystem access through SFTP</li>
</ul>
<p>The benefit is obvious: you write your code once and it will run (in theory) out-of-the-box either on the local filesystem or against a remote filesystem.</p>
<p>And in fact: my code that I wrote and tested originally only against the local filesystem worked basically out-of-the-box with Amazon S3 and over SFTP. Support for Dropbox over <a class="external-link" href="https://github.com/btimby/fs-dropbox" target="_self" title="">dropbox-fs </a>has been added yesterday. This took longer than expected because Dropbox provides only access through OAuth. So I had to automate the complete OAuth request/acknowledge game that usually happens manually using some lines of mechanize in Python. So Dropbox supports works in general however the underlaying dropbox-fs or the Dropbox Python SDK seems to be a bit flaky - but the errors are reproducable - so there is hope that the issues can be fixed easily.</p>
<p>Produce &amp; Publish now got a solid filesystem storage basis (instead of Plone-only). This will make the further progress so much easier and more straight-forward than depending on the Plone-API and Plone annoyances only.</p>

        <div id="parent-fieldname-text" class="plain">
            <p>Lately I worked on the relaunch of my company website <a class="external-link" href="http://www.zopyx.de/" target="_self" title="">zopyx.de</a>. The site is based on Plone 4.2 and uses Twitter Bootstrap for the public website. Using Bootstrap made the site out of the box responsive. But having a <em>responsive</em> site can mean all and nothing. Bootstrap tries to reach responsiveness basically by using CSS3 media queries (and partly Javascript). The default result using Bootstrap was nice but far away been perfect or ready for production.</p>
<p>Issues I had with Bootstrap:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>The site uses IFRAMES for embedding </span><a class="external-link" href="http://www.zopyx.de/unternehmen/media/videos-andreas-jung" target="_self" title="">YouTube videos</a><span> and </span><a class="external-link" href="http://www.zopyx.de/unternehmen/media/vortraege" target="_self" title="">Slideshare presentations</a>. In general it is necessary to specify a fixed width or height for the IFRAME. This is not much acceptable for a responsive a design. Using some Javascript code it was possible to adjust the width and height of the IFRAME upon orientation changes or resizing of the browser window in relation to the width the outer container.</li>
<li>At the bottom of the<a class="external-link" href="http:// zopyx.de/" target="_self" title=""> zopyx.de</a> front-page there is an image section with reference customer logos. The number of images to be displayed depends on the width of the browser windows (for desktop browser I am using six images, iPad in landscape mode shows up with five images and iPad in portrait mode displays 4 images). By default Bootstrap on iPad moved two references logos into a second row because six images did not fit into one row...working but ugly....as a workaround I added some media queries just hiding the 5th or 6th logo depending on the width of the browser window.</li>
<li>For iPhone I made the decision to disable parts of the front-page e.g. the large image slider and the customer references do not show up  (display: none). However the images are still being loaded although not loaded...nasty and a waste of bandwidth.</li>
<li>Image sizes - different devices require different image sizes/resolutions. This is a limitation of HTML. Although there are some Javascript approaches available as workaround or some people are using CSS tricks....this is all tinkering. There is perhaps relief available in the future since the W3C is discussing a proposal (I think it is called "image sets") in order to specify different URLs representing one image when using a particular screen width or so.</li>
<li>Loading of resources: on a mobile device you are perhaps using a stripped down version of the original site (e.g. without sliders as stated above). In such a case I don't need to include related resources like Javascript/CSS for the slider for iPhone or iPad. Right now it is hard  bring this in line with media queries. Using media queries I can decide what to display or not but the decision to include a particular Javascript or CSS for rendering can only be done on the server.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although I am pretty happy with the result so far I am convinced that the current programming model for responsive sites is partly broken.  </p>
<p>Decisions when to render <em>what</em> and <em>how</em> is scattered among different places</p>
<ul>
<li><span>CSS (with media queries)</span></li>
<li><span>client-side Javascript code </span></li>
<li><span>backend code</span></li>
</ul>
<div>I also did further investigations on the topic and sniffed into related frameworks like Foundation or other Grid systems...none of them addresses or resolves the problems mentioned above. Next I will look into more Javascript-driven frameworks.</div>

            <p>I am currently working on the relaunch of my Produce &amp; Publish product site. I decided to go with Pyramid (instead of Plone) this time since different functionality has to be integrated under one hood. The core application is based on a twitter/bootstrap theme (nothing special so far). I wrote already a bunch of documentation using Sphinx (result hosted on <a class="external-link" href="http://docs.produce-and-publish.com/">docs.produce-and-publish.com</a>). Now the Sphinx site/content should be integrated into the Pyramid application. One option would be using a dedicated twitter/bootstrap theme for Sphinx or using Diazo. I decided against both options. A twitter/bootstrap theme for Sphinx is doable but requires double work (keeping the twitter/bootstrap theme in Sphinx and Pyramid in sync). Using Diazo also was not much appealing...yet another moving part.</p>
<p>The solution I come up with is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Sphinx supports the export/generation of the content as JSON (JSON builder aka "make json").</span></li>
<li><span>The generated JSON documents can be used easily inside my Pyramid application through a tiny traverser dealing with paths and extensions</span></li>
<li><span>The traverser code can be found here: </span><a href="https://github.com/zopyx/zopyx.pyramid.ppdemo/blob/master/ppdemo/views.py">https://github.com/zopyx/zopyx.pyramid.ppdemo/blob/master/ppdemo/views.py</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Now traversing to /documentation/index will cause Pyramid to traverse into a specific part of the filesystem holding the documentation JSON-ified by Sphinx, picking up the JSON data and rendering it using a tiny template (see <a href="https://github.com/zopyx/zopyx.pyramid.ppdemo/blob/master/ppdemo/templates/sphinx.pt">https://github.com/zopyx/zopyx.pyramid.ppdemo/blob/master/ppdemo/templates/sphinx.pt</a>).</p>
<p>Disclaimer: the code is a proof of concept and more a hack than a final solution...but it works nicely so far...all image are being display and all links are fully working</p>
