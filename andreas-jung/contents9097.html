            <div><h2>Episode 1</h2>
<p>We participated in a pitch last year for relaunching the portal of an educational institution. They were already using Plone but wanted a new fresh look &amp; feel. We lost the pitch at the end and the contract went to a Typo 3 company and the relaunch was implemented with Typo 3. After looking at the site we came the conclusion that it could have been done in a similar way with Plone. In fact we presented a bunch Web-2.0-ish stuff they were obviously interested in. Asking back about the decision to choose Typo 3 over Plone give some pretty nice insights in decision making processes. Typo 3 was chosen because the their presentation was nice and fresh. Technology did not matter. Aspects like security did not matter. Users and editors using the system all day long did not matter. Public relations decided - Amen.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Episode 2</h2>
<p>Once again an educational institution using Plone for internal and external portals successfully for years (especially because of FacultyStaffDirectory and CMFBibliographyAT) are now considering to move to Typo 3. One of main arguments for Typo 3 can obviously from the system adminstration: Typo 3 would be easier to update. This is perhaps ready  (and necessary when you know about the security records of PHP and PHP apps). But wait...anybody asking the users for their opinion about a new CMS? Anybody ever asked them about their idea and the functionality they need. No. So system administrator are obviously more important when choosing a CMS than the user - Amen.</p>
<p>...no idea how to reasonably end this blog entry - I am just out of ideas how to deal with such customers :-&gt;</p>

Python, Zope and Plone will remain a major part of my own business with <a href="http://www.zopyx.com/">ZOPYX</a> but I will also concentrate on my core competences and extend my activities in the field of electronic publishing. There will not be any changes with my commitment to the Zope Foundation and the DZUG where I am deeply involved in. I just need some more time for the fun and interesting things...Zope 2 will remain in the wild for some more years but I also have to keep up with with new technology like BFG. <b><br /></b></p><p> </p><p>Thank you all for the fish and I hope to see some of you at some upcoming conference or sprint!</p><p>Andreas</p></div>

        <div id="parent-fieldname-text" class="plain">
            <div><p>Writing Plone portlets is still pretty hard. Even as an experienced Plone programmer I usually have to check Martin Aspeli's book or check older code in order to remember how the implementation must look like. My general impression about the Plone portlets implementation: too complex, over-designed and unfriendly to average developers. So this blog entry tells you about some rough ideas about how portlet writing in Plone should look like from the prospective of a developer.</p> <h2>What are portlets?</h2> <p>Portlets are conceptually just a component providing a piece of HTML content that is rendered by some manager within some context. The concept of a (browser) view is basically pretty similar to the functionality of a portlet.</p> <h2>Usecases</h2> <h3>A simple portlet implemented with a template</h3> <p>In Plone 2 portlets were just simple page templates providing a dedicated macro "portlet". So portlet were very easy to write and configure (beside Plone 2 had no notion of portlet assigment). Within Plone I want to be able to write a small piece of template implementing the functionality and I want to be able to register it using ZCML with:</p> <pre>
&lt;plone:portlet
    for="my.package.interfaces.ISomething"
    title="My cool portlet"
    template="something_portlet.pt"
/&gt;<br type="_moz" /></pre> <p>No Python code involved - just a template and an easy snippet of ZCML registration</p> <h3>A simple portlet with some Python code</h3> <p>A portlet implementation might need some additional logic (because we don't want complex logic within our templates. So our implementation may look like a brower view:</p> <pre>
class SomethingPortlet(SomeMagicPortletBase):

     template = ViewPageTemplateFile('something_portlet.pt')

     def helperMethod1(self):
       .....

     def helperMethod2(self):
      ...<br /></pre> <p>And the registration with Plone will look similar to a browser view:</p> <pre style="font-family: Monaco, 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-size: 12px; padding-top: 1em; padding-right: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 1em; border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; border-top-color: rgb(140, 172, 187); border-right-color: rgb(140, 172, 187); border-bottom-color: rgb(140, 172, 187); border-left-color: rgb(140, 172, 187); color: black; background-color: rgb(222, 231, 236); overflow-x: auto; overflow-y: auto; ">
&lt;plone:portlet
    for="my.package.interfaces.ISomething"
    title="My cool portlet"
    class="something.SomethingPortlet"
/&gt;</pre> <h3>A portlet with configuration parameters</h3> <p>Complex portlet may need persistent parameters like #items to be displayed with the portlet. This is expressed through a schema (also similar with browser views):</p> <p>

            <div><p>ZODB conflict resolution is a build-in mechanism of the ZODB for resolving (write) conflict errors. Applications can implement application-specific conflict resolution handlers by providing their own <em>_p_resolveConflict()</em> implementation. Most people do not know that conflict resolution with a ZEO environment is carried on the ZEO server and not on the ZEO clients. This implies that related application code must be available and importable by the ZEO server. The bin/zeoserver control file generated by the plone.recipe.zope2zeoserver recipe for zc.buildout <u>does not include</u> your Zope products and other modules within the sys.path and PYTHONPATH of the control file. However there is an easy way to include other packages (as eggs) with <em>sys.path</em> and <em>PYTHONPATH</em>. You just have to use the (undocumented) eggs option within the ZEO server part of your buildout.cfg:</p><p> </p><pre>
[buildout]parts = zeoservereggs = ...[zeoserver]recipe = plone.recipe.zope2zeoservereggs = ${buildout:eggs}</pre><p> </p></div>

            <div><p> Over the last year I had to deal with a major Zope code fork within our company.</p><p>Here was the situation:</p><ul><li>a co-worker decided some years ago that it would be a good idea to import a Zope 2.8 release into our company internal repository and modify it heavily over the years</li><li>in 2008 we accumulated a number of about 50 or more feature modifications within our fork of Zope 2.8</li><li>with the upcoming of new Zope releases - especially Zope 2.11 - we had the need to migrate to a newer Zope version</li><li>the co-worker got the great task to refactor all his changes and forward port them into dedicated feature branches on top of Zope 2.11 (you can imagine this was a lot of work)</li><li>this work resulted in roughly 45 SVN branches (from a single one-line bugfix to major modifications and extensions of Zope and related modules - including ZODB)</li></ul><p>After the co-worker left the company, I had to deal with this legacy. It took a huge amount of work by several persons walking through each individual feature branch and decide which of the features could be useful for integration with the mainstream code bases (Zope2, CMF, ZODB and some other modules like ZConfig). And it took also several days for the reintegration of the useful features into the public repositories.</p><p>Another code fork came on my desk some days ago. A customer presented its own heavily patched and extended version of some well-known product available from PyPI and the Collective. Tasks to be done: fixing the code of former internal maintainer and extending the functionality with new features. First steps were:</p><ul><li>figuring out the branch point</li><li>figuring out the internal changes made after forking the code (this is hard with a 5000 line diff!)</li><li>creating a branch within the collective based on the original branch point and applying the internal changes as patch back to the codebase within the Collective</li><li>throwing away and rewriting half of the code of the former internal maintainer</li></ul><p> </p><h3>Lessons learned</h3><ul><li>a code fork is easily done and is a good way for adding your own features to a code-base for internal usage</li><li>reintegration of a code fork into the mainstream repository is a pita, extremely complex and provides a lot of risks</li><li>avoid code forks whenever you can</li></ul><p> </p><h3>If you have <strong>serious </strong>needs for forking code</h3><ul><li>create branches within the repository of the mainstream code (it is not so hard to get committer rights for the Zope and Plone repositories)</li><li>communicate and talk to the maintainers of the a particular module or codebase and ask them about their opinion e.g. if there is a feature that might be useful for the public</li><li>document and comment your changes with the same quality within your fork as you would do it (and usually obliged to do so) within a public repository</li><li>take over responsibility for a particular module or codebase when you are working on it and when you see that there is no current maintainer  - users of the module will thank you that it is supported and maintained again. </li><li>don't think that you are smarter than others and do share your code </li><li>avoid any kind of autistic view on the world  - look left and right - avoid doing "your-own-thing" - play nice with others within an open-source community (especially when the success of your own projects and business depends on exactly this community). </li></ul><p> </p><p>A side note: I never had to maintain private forks of any module within our company or for customer projects. All related changes were made in public repositories and in most of the cases they have been merged back into the mainstream codebase.

        <div id="parent-fieldname-text" class="plain">
            <div><p>Two days ago I a gave a lightning talk at the Plone Conference 2009 in Budapest and introduced the new <a href="http://www.produce-and-publish.com/">Produce &amp; Publish</a> server as a solution for producing high-quality PDF documents. Appearently some people dislike (or should I say they are pissed off as I heard from people behind my back) the solution just because it uses a commercial converter backend in order for achieving a real good output quality. To those people who think that any software should be free as beer:</p><ul><li>the software quality matters in the first place (and not the price)</li><li>there is no software project without costs - never ever - even the dumbest programmer at an organization costs you money and pain</li><li>programmers and solutions providers have to live from something and pay their bills</li></ul><p>Let's look at the particular case of the Produce &amp; Publish server and the PrinceXML converter backend:</p><ul><li>PrinceXML costs about 2700 EUR - a bunch of money <strong>but</strong> comparable solutions like the Adobe Indesign server are much, much, much more expensive so a PrinceXML server license is comparable cheap</li><li>Compare the quality and  flexibility of PrinceXML with everything you get for Plone...you will not find something better (people that are working with the free Apache FOP converter know that it sucks and that FOP or any other XLF-FO based solution will never reach the quality we achieve with PrinceXML).</li><li>There are enough people within organizations trying to setup a reasonable PDF production solution on top of Plone for days and weeks - without reasonable results.  Instead of looking at the price tag of the converter backend, please calculate the costs for your work crew playing and trying out without achieving a reasonable solution or a solution or poor quality.</li><li>In the same way as SmartPrintNG allowed you to hook several converter backends (from free to commercial) you can do the same with the Produce &amp; Publish server (as documented - reading helps). If you want to run the server with a free backend...go ahead.</li></ul><p>So here is the conclusion:</p><ul><li>The Produce &amp; Publish server is a solution for professionals and it is trying to provide the best solution you can get for a reasonable price</li><li>Software must not be free as beer - software has to work and reasonable software has its price tag and there is often no comparable open-source alternative for some particular functionality (as in this case).</li><li>There is no software solution for free. Any software project has its costs - cost for menpower and costs for software components</li></ul><p>And to any person still thinking that I am on the wrong trail: the Produce &amp; Publish server is free. You pay for the third-party converter backends and you pay for integration work. But you are free to use the server with kindergarten-level converters like Apache FOP for free...make your choice: poor quality for free or high quality for a reasonable price or pay some incompetent employees over weeks for reaching nothing or pay for a reasonably-priced solution :-)</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>

Fine - ZClasses are back for people who still depend on them.</p><p>But what is wrong with this package?</p><p>Basically nothing - except its package description is borked in two ways.</p><p>First, it is telling stories that do not belong into a package description on Pypi and second, parts of the statements are just ranting (they belong into a personal blog but not on PyPI).</p><p>The decision to remove ZClasses had a backing by the majority of the active Zope developers. Some of people opened up their mouths from time to time over the last years in order to take the over responsibility over ZClasses - but nobody stepped up. In fact some ZClasses functionality has been broken over several Zope major releases - e.g. the distribution code that was broken since Zope 2.9 (at least).</p><p>Removing ZClasses from the prospective of software quality was more than overdue in Zope 2.12. I've read the critics made within the package description but I just have to ignore it - especially the critic about the "influentual release manager". Zope as an open-source project is steered and directed by those people that actively participate in the community in order to bring the project forward. As a release manager I have a certain influence on the technical aspects of the project but the majority of contributions over the last years had nothing to do with my influence. The release manager is the man with the whip that cares about release dates, bugs and other related things. So the Zope project makes as much progress as each individual project member contributes to the project.</p><p>But as the package author wrote: Zope is open-source and everybody has the freedom baking its cake in private or sharing it with others - or: people who live in the glass houses should not throw stones</p></div>
