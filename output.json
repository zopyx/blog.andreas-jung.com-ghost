The solution was to use the **startupinfo** parameter:\n\n\n> **startupinfo = STARTUPINFO()**\n> \n> **startupinfo.dwFlag |= STARTF\\_USESHOWWINDOW**\n> \n> **P = subprocess.Popen(cmd, shell=False, stderr=PIPE, stdout=PIPE; stdin=open('nul:'), startupinfo=startupinfo)**\n> \n> Now with this solution I could execute Java command without anyone noticing it :-) But....wait....our Java commands also produced some output..maybe only some lines or a hundred warnings..you would expect that you can read the error messages from the **stdout** and **stderr** pipes....surprise, surprise....that worked only for short messages. In case the Java process wrote too much data to **stderr** then whole process was just hanging with the result that **os.wait()** had to wait forever. Because of my limited Windows knowledge I could not track down this problem on Windows 98. So the workaround at this time was to avoid using **stderr** and **stderr** as PIPEs and just setting them to **None.** So with the final solution I was able to run all our converters using the same code on all Windows flavours...but I really took me very long (serveral days with lots of iterations with external testing labs) to figure this all out....and it convinced me again that Windows just a piece of crap...  \n\n\n  \n\n\n   ",

There were some Plone 2.0 beta-something sites, some Plone 1-ish sites...more or less stock Plone instances with a small list on add-ons. Unfortunately the standard Plone migration never worked. Big problem? Perhaps..or perhaps not.<br><br>After running a site for three or four years you collect a lot of trash on your site and you often want to start from scratch when it comes to design and site-structure.  Over this period of time you see people come and go that is reflected within a Plone site as a huge garbage of stale content, messed up permissions and so on. So the general approach is to create a new Plone3 site from scratch and having some mechanism to get your core content over into the new sites with the most important set of metadata. This means you want to migrate the content only and basically don't care about much about any kind site configuration of your old system.<br><br>The idea is pretty simple and not too complicated to implement.

    "body_md": "  Over the last few month I had the pleasure (or pain) migrating several educational Plone sites to current Plone 3 technology. There were some Plone 2.0 beta-something sites, some Plone 1-ish sites...more or less stock Plone instances with a small list on add-ons. Unfortunately the standard Plone migration never worked. Big problem? Perhaps..or perhaps not.  \n  \nAfter running a site for three or four years you collect a lot of trash on your site and you often want to start from scratch when it comes to design and site-structure. Over this period of time you see people come and go that is reflected within a Plone site as a huge garbage of stale content, messed up permissions and so on. So the general approach is to create a new Plone3 site from scratch and having some mechanism to get your core content over into the new sites with the most important set of metadata. This means you want to migrate the content only and basically don't care about much about any kind site configuration of your old system.  \n  \nThe idea is pretty simple and not too complicated to implement.

So this blog entry tells you about some rough ideas about how portlet writing in Plone should look like from the prospective of a developer.\n\n What are portlets?\n------------------\n\n Portlets are conceptually just a component providing a piece of HTML content that is rendered by some manager within some context. The concept of a (browser) view is basically pretty similar to the functionality of a portlet.\n\n Usecases\n--------\n\n ### A simple portlet implemented with a template\n\n In Plone 2 portlets were just simple page templates providing a dedicated macro \"portlet\". So portlet were very easy to write and configure (beside Plone 2 had no notion of portlet assigment). Within Plone I want to be able to write a small piece of template implementing the functionality and I want to be able to register it using ZCML with:\n\n  <plone:portlet for=\"my.package.interfaces.ISomething\" title=\"My cool portlet\" template=\"something\\_portlet.pt\" />  \n No Python code involved - just a template and an easy snippet of ZCML registration\n\n ### A simple portlet with some Python code\n\n A portlet implementation might need some additional logic (because we don't want complex logic within our templates. So our implementation may look like a brower view:\n\n  class SomethingPortlet(SomeMagicPortletBase): template = ViewPageTemplateFile('something\\_portlet.pt') def helperMethod1(self): ..... def helperMethod2(self): ...  \n And the registration with Plone will look similar to a browser view:\n\n  <plone:portlet for=\"my.package.interfaces.ISomething\" title=\"My cool portlet\" class=\"something.SomethingPortlet\" /> ### A portlet with configuration parameters\n\n Complex portlet may need persistent parameters like #items to be displayed with the portlet.

It was a great conference with about 170 attendees - both Plone developers, Plone users and interested people.

It was a great conference with about 170 attendees - both Plone developers, Plone users and interested people. Especially a lot of new people from the Plone users side made this conference an interesting event - lots of interesting people and interesting conversations.\n\n I gave a talk on the state of producing, publishing and distribution of electronic contents using our [Produce & Publish](http://www.produce-and-publish.com/) plattform ([slides](http://www.slideshare.net/ajung/produce-publish-plone-konferenz-2012), German only).\n\n By accident an attendee point me to a PDF converter with similar capabilities to our current converter PrinceXML used for professional high-quality PDF documents. The new converter is PDFreactor and is in many ways comparable to PrinceXML. It also accepts HTML/XML for the content part and supports the styling of output PDF document through CSS. In fact PDFreactor provides a similar output compared to PrinceXML when using the unmodified stylesheets of Produce & Publish by default.\n\n ### Some remarkable differences (and advantages over PrinceXML) are\n\n \n * support for tagged PDFs (PDF/a)\n * support for images in CMYK colorspace\n * generates PDF forms\n * PDF signing and encryption\n * support for generating barcodes and QR codes\n * slightly cheaper than PrinceXML\n \n ### Downsides of PDFreactor\n\n \n * slower (based on Java) but supports a webservice API to avoid startup times [**Update**: PDFreactor is usually run as a server process and access through a webservice API)\n * significant higher memory fingerprint \n * no floating of images or tables [**Update**: floating is possible]\n * font-configuration not possible through CSS (fonts must be configured as part of the PDFreactor configuration) [**Update**: PDFreactor version 6 now supports arbitrary webfonts]\n \n ### What are the benefits for the Produce & Publish plattform?\n\n \n * another high-quality PDF converter option\n * more scenarios where Produce & Publish might ba good choice\n * optional PDF generation of accessible PDF documents when needed\n * (optional) support of PDFreactor on the Produce & Publish server side (through the newest zopyx.convert2 module with support for PDFreactor)\n * (optional) support of PDFreactor through the Produce & Publish Plone client connector (converter=pdf-pdfreactor parameter)\n * no direct support for PDFreactor for generating PDF from within the Produce & Publish Authoring Environment (hard-coded PDF converter name - likely to be lifted soon)\n \n    ",

Using Diazo also was not much appealing...yet another moving part.\n\n The solution I come up with is the following:\n\n \n * Sphinx supports the export/generation of the content as JSON (JSON builder aka \"make json\").\n * The generated JSON documents can be used easily inside my Pyramid application through a tiny traverser dealing with paths and extensions\n * The traverser code can be found here: <https://github.com/zopyx/zopyx.pyramid.ppdemo/blob/master/ppdemo/views.py>\n \n Now traversing to /documentation/index will cause Pyramid to traverse into a specific part of the filesystem holding the documentation JSON-ified by Sphinx, picking up the JSON data and rendering it using a tiny template (see <https://github.com/zopyx/zopyx.pyramid.ppdemo/blob/master/ppdemo/templates/sphinx.pt>).\n\n Disclaimer: the code is a proof of concept and more a hack than a final solution...but it works nicely so far...all image are being display and all links are fully working\n\n   ",

You and your personal health should have the highest priority. Don't ruin yourself for whatever reason. Your health is your capital.</p>\n<h3 class=\" \">Don't be reachable at any time</h3>\n<p>Whatever position you have in a project: you don't have to be reachable at any time for any person. Give your working day a structure. Consider fixed working hours that you do not exceed. </p>\n<h3 class=\" \">Avoid overtime</h3>\n<p>Overtime is a bad thing. Yes, things must be done at some point but constant overtime is bad for your health and mood - unless you are a coding maniac. </p>\n<h3 class=\" \">Don't be a slave of your email client</h3>\n<p>Reduce to poll time of your email client to one hour or so - being interrupted while programming is a bad thing. </p>\n<h3 class=\" \">Delay email replies</h3>\n<p>There are email client add-ons like SendItlater that allow you to answer to an email directly but defer the delivery to a some time in the future. This may slow down email ping-pong between and your customers significantly. </p>\n<h3 class=\" \">Have separate email clients</h3>\n<p>For some projects (with lots of email during the day and night) I use a dedicated email client that I can close at any time. I use my standard email client to keep track of my private email and other project email (where I know that there will be only a few mails per day without a big risk of trouble)</p>\n<h3 class=\" \">Do not respond to all email the same day</h3>\n<p>If there is some email coming in the late afternoon and you can already smell the trouble by reading the sender or the subject: keep it closed and read it the other day. Do not ruin your last working hour and the rest of the day with trouble emails.</p>\n<h3 class=\" \">Smell the stress</h3>\n<p>It takes some experiences to notice when the project stress turns against you. Stress can have various symptoms and they are very individual.

    "body_md": "  This is a short and unsorted collection of personal wisdoms that may help you improving your day and life as a software developer, freelancer, project manager or whatever.\n\n ### You first, projects second\n\n The first think that counts is you . You and your personal health should have the highest priority. Don't ruin yourself for whatever reason. Your health is your capital.\n\n ### Don't be reachable at any time\n\n Whatever position you have in a project: you don't have to be reachable at any time for any person. Give your working day a structure. Consider fixed working hours that you do not exceed. \n\n ### Avoid overtime\n\n Overtime is a bad thing. Yes, things must be done at some point but constant overtime is bad for your health and mood - unless you are a coding maniac. \n\n ### Don't be a slave of your email client\n\n Reduce to poll time of your email client to one hour or so - being interrupted while programming is a bad thing. \n\n ### Delay email replies\n\n There are email client add-ons like SendItlater that allow you to answer to an email directly but defer the delivery to a some time in the future. This may slow down email ping-pong between and your customers significantly. \n\n ### Have separate email clients\n\n For some projects (with lots of email during the day and night) I use a dedicated email client that I can close at any time. I use my standard email client to keep track of my private email and other project email (where I know that there will be only a few mails per day without a big risk of trouble)\n\n ### Do not respond to all email the same day\n\n If there is some email coming in the late afternoon and you can already smell the trouble by reading the sender or the subject: keep it closed and read it the other day. Do not ruin your last working hour and the rest of the day with trouble emails.\n\n ### Smell the stress\n\n It takes some experiences to notice when the project stress turns against you. Stress can have various symptoms and they are very individual. Personally I notice upcoming stress situation through problems with my stomach.\n\n ### Get out of the stress\n\n This is often easier said than doable in reality. But if often helps taking a break for an hour or two and doing sports. First it reduces my aggression level and gives me a more clear thought on some pending problems. Or if you can: take a day off and do something completely different.\n\n ### Know your limits\n\n Know yourself! You have to know where your personal limits are and how far you can go. While we are all getting older we have to recognize that we can not handle a workload as when we were ten years younger. It does not mean that we are less efficient and effective but we deal with workloads in a different way.\n\n It is you that counts, it is your health that counts.

Legacy support for Apache FOP, XInc and XMLMind converters have been removed (not much used, poor output quality, unmaintained). In addition the server provide conversion support using LibreOffice or OpenOffice for office format A to office format B using the Python-based wrapper <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/unoconv/\" target=\"_self\" title=\"\">unoconv</a>.

The Produce & Publish server provides some web service API methods that all arbitrary application to convert their content to PDF through a central conversion server. The PDF generation is (as in the past) based on one of the following PDF converters:\n\n \n * PrinceXML 8\n * PDFreactor 6\n * Anntennahouse Formatter V 6\n \n The general conversion approach remains the same:  \n * all conversions are based on HTML/XML as input\n * styling is accomplished through CSS3\n \n The new Produce & Publish Server implementation is also past as the older version on Python Pyramid and it provides its services through an XML-RPC API. Legacy support for Apache FOP, XInc and XMLMind converters have been removed (not much used, poor output quality, unmaintained). In addition the server provide conversion support using LibreOffice or OpenOffice for office format A to office format B using the Python-based wrapper [unoconv](http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/unoconv/). This API will be used later to provide a simple DOCX conversion and import functionality for the Produce & Publish backend. All API methods support asynchronous processing (e.g. for larger documents). In this case the caller receives a job id that can be used to poll and download the converted document.   The Produce & Publish server remains open-source (published under the GNU Public License V2). ### \n\n ### Resources\n\n  \n * [pp.server](https://bitbucket.org/ajung/pp.server/src/c874a08127fbc6b5281134de8afee989104f666d/src/pp.server?at=master)\n * [pp.client](https://bitbucket.org/ajung/pp.server/src/c874a08127fbc6b5281134de8afee989104f666d/src/pp.client?at=master)\n \n    ",

(\"Formatvorlage\" in German) are preserved as CSS class in the HTML. So when the original DOCX document contains a paragraph marked as \"address\" we will have <p class=\"address\"> in the HTML. This makes it easy to apply global styles to common CSS classes as used for example as part of a company-wide DOCX template.\n\n ![](Screenshot2013071519.25.54.png/%40%40images/4533655d-aff9-4462-968a-cb959ac65f47.png)\n\n   ",

The EuroPython conference is the second largest global conference for the popular programming language Python, after the PyCon US conference in North America. The bcc is located at the central Alexander Square. It offers ideal facilities for a developer conference on 3,000 m2. The organizers are expecting up to 1,200 participants, continuing the growth of the EuroPython conference series. The very successful EuroPython this year attracted almost 900 Python enthusiasts. It was hosted in Florence, Italy for the third time running.</p>\n<p class=\" \">Berlin offers ideal conditions for a large international developer conference. The city with its about 2,500 young businesses has a large and fast-growing start-up scene. 300 universities, polytechnics, research institutes and technology parks underline Berlin's importance as one of Europe's leading science and research locations. Thanks to its rich cultural landscape with around 180 museums, renowned international art collections and precious works of art as well as a lively art and music scene, Berlin is one of the most vibrant and vividly creative metropolitan centers in Europe. Its attractions and excellent national and international transport links have already put Berlin among the top three in the international conference and congress region rankings.</p>\n<p class=\" \">The conference will be organized locally by the Python Software Verband e.V., the Python Users Berlin, the Django User Group Berlin and the PyLadies Berlin, in cooperation with the EuroPython Society for the Python community. With five lecture tracks and two tutorial tracks running in parallel, the EuroPython conference offers an attractive schedule for all attendees.</p>\n<p class=\" \">The EuroPython 2014 logo expresses what is on the organizer's minds, which is getting people from very different areas of expertise together to communicate. Python is used as a programming language in industrial and service enterprises as well as in research and education. The EuroPython brings together developers who work together on fascinating tasks and as a result have found unique solutions to their problems.</p>\n<h3 class=\" \">About Python</h3>\n<p class=\" \">Python is an interpreted high-level language. In the TIOBE index Python has featured among the top 10 of favorite programming languages for years. Python is ideal for development. It is a lean language that is easy to learn for both developers and users. The language was created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum. Today, the language is developed by a large open source community and backed by the Python Software Foundation (PSF), which owns the copyright to Python.</p>\n<h3 class=\" \">About the Python Software Verband e.V.</h3>\n<p class=\" \">The Python Software Verband e.V. represents the interests of the German-speaking Python community. It is a German non-profit organization that focuses on promoting the Python programming language and supports activities of different Python interests groups.

The EuroPython conference is the second largest global conference for the popular programming language Python, after the PyCon US conference in North America. The bcc is located at the central Alexander Square. It offers ideal facilities for a developer conference on 3,000 m2. The organizers are expecting up to 1,200 participants, continuing the growth of the EuroPython conference series. The very successful EuroPython this year attracted almost 900 Python enthusiasts. It was hosted in Florence, Italy for the third time running.\n\n Berlin offers ideal conditions for a large international developer conference. The city with its about 2,500 young businesses has a large and fast-growing start-up scene. 300 universities, polytechnics, research institutes and technology parks underline Berlin's importance as one of Europe's leading science and research locations. Thanks to its rich cultural landscape with around 180 museums, renowned international art collections and precious works of art as well as a lively art and music scene, Berlin is one of the most vibrant and vividly creative metropolitan centers in Europe. Its attractions and excellent national and international transport links have already put Berlin among the top three in the international conference and congress region rankings.\n\n The conference will be organized locally by the Python Software Verband e.V., the Python Users Berlin, the Django User Group Berlin and the PyLadies Berlin, in cooperation with the EuroPython Society for the Python community. With five lecture tracks and two tutorial tracks running in parallel, the EuroPython conference offers an attractive schedule for all attendees.\n\n The EuroPython 2014 logo expresses what is on the organizer's minds, which is getting people from very different areas of expertise together to communicate. Python is used as a programming language in industrial and service enterprises as well as in research and education. The EuroPython brings together developers who work together on fascinating tasks and as a result have found unique solutions to their problems.\n\n ### About Python\n\n Python is an interpreted high-level language. In the TIOBE index Python has featured among the top 10 of favorite programming languages for years. Python is ideal for development. It is a lean language that is easy to learn for both developers and users. The language was created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum. Today, the language is developed by a large open source community and backed by the Python Software Foundation (PSF), which owns the copyright to Python.\n\n ### About the Python Software Verband e.V.\n\n The Python Software Verband e.V. represents the interests of the German-speaking Python community. It is a German non-profit organization that focuses on promoting the Python programming language and supports activities of different Python interests groups. Its members are involved in a wide range of Python activities including Python core development and many Open Source projects.\n\n ### About the EuroPython Society\n\n The EuroPython Society (EPS) is a Swedish non-profit organization which holds the rights to the EuroPython conference series and trademarks.

Re-running the instance and re-rendering the object produced the following output:\n\n \\_p\\_serial ���:S��  \n\\_p\\_estimated\\_size 3634  \n\\_\\_provides\\_\\_ <zope.interface.Provides object at 0x7f150caad490>  \n\\_\\_provides\\_\\_ <zope.interface.Provides object at 0x7f150caad490>  \n\\_p\\_serial ��v(w  \n\\_p\\_estimated\\_size 3301 The \\_p\\_ attributes are internal attributes used by the ZODB - they appeared normal however there were also changes to the \\_\\_provides\\_\\_ attribute of the instance. This happens usually when you attach a marker interface to a persistent object using alsoProvides(). So we grepped through the code and found this:\n\n def get\\_average\\_rating(self):  \n alsoProvides(self, IUserRatable)  \n adapted = IUserRating(self)  \n return adapted.averageRating  \n  \ndef get\\_rating\\_count(self):  \n alsoProvides(self, IUserRatable)  \n adapted = IUserRating(self)  \n return adapted.numberOfRatings\n\n Both methods are called during the rendering of the 'view' view and with every call it re-attaches/modifies the IUserRatable interface to the instance of the Artikel.....BAD BAD BAD.....moving the code to a place where is is called only once per object resolved the issue and the ZODB bloat.\n\n   ",

Several people worked partly full-time on this project (beside their usual job and business). A not so perfect role during the organization process played the EuroPython Society (EPS).  The EPS is a non-profit society under Swedish law and is the  holder of the „EuroPython“ trademark. The EPS holds this trademark since some weeks.</p>\n\n<p>The goals of the EPS are according to their <a href=\"http://www.europython-society.org/bylaws\">bylaws</a>:</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><strong>2. The society is a non-profit society (ideel förening) under Swedish law. The purpose of the EP is to organise conferences centered around the programming language Python</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is in general a very honorable goal but goals and reality are two different things. The first public discussion about problems between the Berlin organizers and the EPS popped up early 2014 with an email (<a href=\"https://mail.python.org/pipermail/europython/2014-January/008250.html\">https://mail.python.org/pipermail/europython/2014-January/008250.html</a>, <a href=\"https://mail.python.org/pipermail/europython/2014-January/008252.html\">https://mail.python.org/pipermail/europython/2014-January/008252.html</a>) of a former EPS member which basically brought the complete situation with the EPS to the point. Although I was not directly involved with the communication between EPS and the Berlin organizers I can only summarize the behavior of the EPS  as only-demanding, an arrogant top-down attitude and a conduct that is far away from being acceptable for an open-source community.  Speaking of „the EPS“ as an organization is perhaps not valid because there are always persons connected with an association - approachable persons, non-approachable persons and silent persons.</p>\n\n<p>Some weeks ago I became an official member of EPS and had the pleasure to participate in the general assembly of the EPS held during the EuroPython 2014 conference in Berlin. The first weird thing was that there was a total of 30 minutes planned for the general assembly which includes reports of the chairman, the treasurer, discharge of the board, voting of the new board and especially discussions. How strange I thought from the beginning. A typical general assembly of comparable organizations hardly take under  90 minutes, usually even longer.</p>\n\n<p>EPS counted 68 members at the time of the general assembly where about 30 members joined the EPS shortly before general assembly. Out of these 68 members only 14 members appeared to the general assembly including two of the five EPS board members (Fabio Pliger, Marc-André Lemburg).</p>\n\n<p>This one hour general assembly appears in the retrospective like a bad theater piece of a provincial theater. The board was not able to give a reasonable report over the last year and always stressed out about mistakes made in the past. For example  there are no records and protocols available of board meetings and general assemblies available for the last years - either lack of transparency or just a complete unorganized society.</p>\n\n<p>Marc-André Lemburg was not able to give a reasonable and acceptable financial report (the slides really contained „XX Euro“). He could just give a vague estimate on the money that EPS has in the bank - not very much money as it turned out. Dear EPS, every rabbit breeders association is better organized.</p>\n\n<p>They have five persons on the board and their only day business is to meta-organize a EuroPython conference and dealing with EuroPython trademark issues.  The real organization work is always carried out by the local organizers.</p>\n\n<p>What are these people doing? Especially when the trademark issue was the only major operation carried out over the last 12 months?</p>\n\n<p>Then the voting for the board…too make it short: old board = new board. All members of the old board became elected as new board members. Both Fabio and Marc-André had been involved (in a good and bad way) with the Berlin organizers over the last year. All other board members (Jacob, Anton, Vicky) are not very well known in the European Python community and had been elected in absence - legal and covered by the bylaws but a slightly absurd election. I felt a bit like in the 80s with the election processes of the politbureau in communist or socialist states.</p>\n\n<p>One might argue why I did not run myself for the board? Answer: lack of information about the EPS and their current inner state in advance, lack of knowledge about all candidates and especially where was no significant possibility for changing the power within the EPS at this point.</p>\n\n<p>Let us talk about the „EuroPython“ trademark. The EPS claimed from the beginning of the EP14 organization that they would hold the „EuroPython“ trademark. However EPS could never provide any evidence. In fact the trademark was granted to EPS some weeks before the conference. But EPS urged the Berlin organizers  multiple times to include the trademark claim in press releases and on EuroPython 2014 related information The conference was organized by officially under the hood of the Python Software Verband e.V. - a society under German law. And according to German law we could not support this trademark claim. However EPS always insisted on their point of view. The organizers had to comply with German law and not with Swedish law in this case.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of legal issues: EPS tried for the first time to regulate the relation between EPS and the local organizers with a contract. To our knowledge there had been never contracts for former EuroPython conferences in the past. To make it short: the draft of this contract had to be rejected by the organizers because it was completely one-sided. These kind of contracts can be made between businesses but not between entities of an open-source community. The cumulation of insolence was the requirement that a conference profit should be split 50:50 between EPS and local organizers but a conference loss should be carried by the organizers themselves with a maximum involvement of the EPS limited to 7.500 Euro. You could read the draft as: we do nothing and get half of the money but it is your risk if there is a loss. Fortunately EPS showed some insight during the general assembly that this contract was a mistake.</p>\n\n<p>The new EPS approach: EPS want to take more control over the EuroPython conference organization, EPS wants to be the main contracting partner and it want the organization to be taken over by permanent teams. This is approach will never ever work out. Like with all projects: a small amount of people will be doing the major work and these people will be local organizers. It is not imaginable that other EPS member will and can spend a significant amount their personal time in leading positions dealing with local organization issues. The programm committee of EuroPython 2014 as an example was already internationally distributed organized. It did not solve the problem that the programme chair had the burden with organizing the programme. It is unlikely that the chair of EP14 would take over the responsibility for a theoratical EP15 that would not take place in Berlin. The key position of conference organization teams are time-consuming and exhausing and you do it for one or two years - especially when you take into account that many of the organizers run their own businesses. No, the workgroup approach is a nice idea but it is going to fail. There are too many local aspects in a conference organization that can not be handled by EPS or EPS workgroups. Yes, EPS wants, wants a lot...but theses are only visions and dreams that will not become reality. Life is different, EPS never organized a conference, EPS just contributed the name.</p>\n\n<p>Talking of EPS persons: Fabio Pliger worked with the Berlin organizers in a goal-oriented and constructive way while others glazed by non-visibility or through their unacceptable arrogant attitude. My respect to Fabio for his support.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"color:#888\">Conclusion</h3>\n\n<p>The EPS is a poorly organized society with little backing by the community and not much assets. The trademark on „EuroPython“ is the only thing that the EPS has in their hands - apart from little money in the bank. EuroPython was an overwhelming success - by numbers and by feedback received by attendees. The experience with EPS tells us that nobody really needs the EPS for organizing a big Python conference in Europe. The only thing that the EPS can provide: the name „EuroPython“. But wait: did you notice our branding „EP14“. Would it be a problem for you visiting a „EP15“ conference instead of „EuroPython 2015“? Or could a similar conference be named „PyCON Europe 2015“ or „Python Europe 2015“ or something like that? You see the problem…the EPS is constructed solely around the name and their trademark „EuroPython“.  </p>\n\n<p>So their are obviously the following options for the future</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Forget EPS and let the local communities do their own thing. EPS can only give the name „EuroPython“ but they are not able to put more effort into controlling and directing the organization of such a big conference nor they have the financial or personal resources for backing a conference themselves. The proposed workgroup model for organizing further conferences is not well thought and will never work in reality for various reasons.</li>\n\t<li>Let us send the current EPS board (except Fabio) into the desert and install persons as board members that are interested in one thing: organizing further great conferences with local organizers in a constructive way instead of defending their only poor assets. There is no reason why the EPS needs a big board of 5 persons. Reduce it to three board members where one member could represent the „old“ EPS and their interests, a treasurer and person representing the local organizers of the upcoming conference…something like that…I admit that this is only a rough thought…</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For the rescue of the EPS: it seems that the EPS got the notice and took their lessons from that what happened over the last year. The European Python community is about people and not about exercising power build on top of a trademarks and a poor standing within the community. The board mentioned that they want to held a new general assembly soon in order to fix the problems. The EPS wants to be more open and transparent. I appreciate these goals but time will tell how this will work out in reality.</p>\n\n<p><br>\n </p>\n\n        </div>\n\n\n         \n    \n\n                            </div>\n                        \n\n                      \n                    ",

The core implementation right now provides traversal support from Plone into those external services including basic UI support for managing folders/collections (add, rename, delete), for up- and downloading content, ZIP export/import and a basic integration with the ACE editor. I am sceptical about a more deeper integration into Plone as it was implemented in Reflecto. I do not think that external content should be treated in a way a primary Plone content.

Plone's content-type framework Dexterity makes it very easy to create new XML-ish content-types either through code or through the web. The existing core feature of Plone like security, role-based user management, fine-grained security model will be full available within XML-Director.</li>\n\t<li>XML-Director will be a storage for XML content (from small to large). XML-Director will support out-of-the-box both XML databases eXist-db and Base-X.</li>\n\t<li>DOCX to XML conversion: XML-Director will provide a pluggable API for integrating external conversion services like C-REX or solutions build on top of open-source software like LibreOffice encapsulated through a webservice. Our goal is to provide out-of-the-box conversion support of DOCX to Docbook and DITA.</li>\n\t<li>PDF generation will be based on our Produce &amp; Publish solution that exists now for many years with PDFreactor and PrinceXML as primary converters. However free solutions like WKHTMLTOPDF will also remain supported.

    "body_md": "  ![](logo-small-transparent.png/image_preview.png \"XML-Director Logo\")\n\n  \n\n I am pleased to announce the start of a new big project in 2015: [**XML Director**](http://xml-director.info/)\n\n **XML-Director** will be a new generation XML content-management-system focused on\n\n \n * openness\n * easy-to-use\n * flexibility\n * combining the best technologies on the market into a superb XML solution\n \n Based on almost 20 years of experience in the electronic publishing and publisher business and based on our experience with Produce & Publish over the last years it is time to bring our tools to the next level. \n\n ### What will XML-Director be?\n\n \n * First, XML-Director will be a classical open-source project open to everyone interested in Plone, XML, CMS, PDF, EPub, conversions etc.\n * A classical CMS solution for XML content with Plone as the basis. Plone's content-type framework Dexterity makes it very easy to create new XML-ish content-types either through code or through the web. The existing core feature of Plone like security, role-based user management, fine-grained security model will be full available within XML-Director.\n * XML-Director will be a storage for XML content (from small to large). XML-Director will support out-of-the-box both XML databases eXist-db and Base-X.\n * DOCX to XML conversion: XML-Director will provide a pluggable API for integrating external conversion services like C-REX or solutions build on top of open-source software like LibreOffice encapsulated through a webservice. Our goal is to provide out-of-the-box conversion support of DOCX to Docbook and DITA.\n * PDF generation will be based on our Produce & Publish solution that exists now for many years with PDFreactor and PrinceXML as primary converters. However free solutions like WKHTMLTOPDF will also remain supported. In addition we are looking into further PDF conversion options like Antennahouse Formatter and Speedata Publisher.\n * Configurable content-types\n * Support for XML metadata either in Plone or XML or mixed\n \n ### Usecases for XML-Director\n\n \n * Technical documentation\n * Authoring and production of guideline documents, SOPs etc.\n * classical XML production and publishing workflows\n \n ### Technical foundation\n\n \n * Plone CMS (version 4.3 and later 5.X)\n * eXist-db or Base-X\n * ElasticSearch\n * PDF conversion: PDFreactor, PrinceXML, WKTOHTMLPDF\n * EPub conversion: Calibre, custom implementation\n * DOCX conversion/import: C-REX, custom implementation\n \n ### Development approach\n\n \n * All modules of XML-Director will be freely available as open-source (GPL2) on [Github](https://github.com/xml-director) \n * Exceptions: \n\t + specific custom solutions build on top of XML-Director where confidentiality is an issue\n\t + commercial converters like PrinceXML or PDFreactor \n * Everyone is invited to participate the project. The code is on Github: fork it and improve it\n \n ### References\n\n \n * [Website](http://xml-director.info/#) (very preliminary)\n * [Project blog](http://blog.xml-director.info/)\n * [XML-Director@Github](http://github.com/xml-director)\n \n  \n\n  \n\n   ",

I recreated the related Docker images on the deployment box from scratch. The bad experience discussed in my former blog posts remained. A typical build under Docker was  5-10 times slower than executing the same scripts and code on the same machine directly under the shell. Pushing the three images - each about 1.3 GB in size - took more than two hours. I have seen that one layer of an image got pushed with a decent speed close to our bandwith limit  while the next layer crawled over the net with 500 KB per second...completely unpredicatable push behavior. The same behavior was reproducible on a different host in a different data center. Pulling the images on a different host also showed same downstream issues with the Docker registry - completely useless and time consuming.</p>\n\n<p>But anyway...running the Docker images on the host caused the next surprise. Starting exist-db, executing a small Plone script for site setup and finally starting the Plone instance takes about ten minutes (under one minute without Docker). The complete virtual machine became very unresponsive during that time with a CPU load going through the roof of up to 10 with no jobs running on the VM except this Docker container. But anyway...I proceeded to the next Docker container and tried to run Base-X and eXist-db. There was a mistake in one of the Dockerfiles and I had to re-run the build for eXist-db. This build suddently failed while running apt-get inside the build....network issues. I checked the log and discovered some issues with the iptables. Not being a network guru I filed a bug report on the Docker repo @Github. It turned out that the Docker chain within iptables configuration got lost and therefore the complete network functionality of the Docker build failed. Nobody could told me where and why this happened. The only manual change done earlier was to add port 80 to the list of public ports - perhaps something was happening here. The only solution to get around the problem is to restart Docker. But restarting Docker also means that your containers go away and need to get restart - major pain in the ass factor...why is Docker so stupid and monolithic that containers can not continue to run? This is bad application design.</p>\n\n<h3>Containers are for software, not for data</h3>\n\n<p>Docker containers are consumables. Docker containers should be used to scale applications, for firing more app servers with the same setup etc. However Docker guys and fan boys want to put data into containers and speak of data containers.

This is kind of a nightmare. Disclosure of customer data, credit card numbers etc....but whom to blame? Of course MongoDB is (technology-wise) a crappy database and it would be easy to blame MongoDB altogether.</p>\n\n<p>There are only two minor problems with MongoDB here: </p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>the MongoDB daemon binds to all public IP addresses by default depending on the distribution or download package. It is said that the standard installers bind to localhost only however the daemon distributed with the binary packages binds to 0.0.0.0 - <strong>BAD DESIGN DECISION</strong> </li>\n\t<li>MongoDB does not require a password by default. So every MongoDB server is open without authentication by default - <strong>BAD DESIGN DECISION</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>However there is no direct technical exploit in MongoDB responsible for the disclosure of private data - just bad design decisions (having their impact here). Unfortunately the <a href=\"http://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-security-best-practices\">answer</a> of MongoDB CTO Eliot Horowitz on this issue is both cheap, weak and poor and one does not seem to care about the implications from this report.</p>\n\n<p>More important in this case is the human factor.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously several thousand adminsitrators are incompetent or incapable performing <strong>very basic</strong> administration tasks like</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>configuring a daemon to localhost or a private IP only</li>\n\t<li>configuring a firewall</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>My theory on this is that more and more untalented IT workers are in charge for dealing with technology issues, networking and programming aspects that are far beyond their horizon. This is not only a problem of MongoDB but can be also observed with other IT technology. Watching mailing lists, IRC, Stackoverflow and other related media over the last years is becoming a growing pain. The technology is getting more and more diverse and complex but the intelligence and motivation of the \"typical\" IT workers seems to go down year by year. Yes, this is a typical Andreas Jung rant but many tasks in software development and system administration should be left to people that know what they are doing.

    "body_md": "   [![MongoDB gate](mongodb-gate/image_mini.png)](mongodb-gate/image/image_view_fullscreen.html)    Yesterday researchers of my home university [Universität des Saarland](http://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html) published a [report](http://cispa.saarland/mongodb/) about 40.000 [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) servers in the world running on public ports and without authentication. This is kind of a nightmare. Disclosure of customer data, credit card numbers etc....but whom to blame? Of course MongoDB is (technology-wise) a crappy database and it would be easy to blame MongoDB altogether.\n\n There are only two minor problems with MongoDB here: \n\n \n * the MongoDB daemon binds to all public IP addresses by default depending on the distribution or download package. It is said that the standard installers bind to localhost only however the daemon distributed with the binary packages binds to 0.0.0.0 - **BAD DESIGN DECISION** \n * MongoDB does not require a password by default. So every MongoDB server is open without authentication by default - **BAD DESIGN DECISION**\n \n However there is no direct technical exploit in MongoDB responsible for the disclosure of private data - just bad design decisions (having their impact here). Unfortunately the [answer](http://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-security-best-practices) of MongoDB CTO Eliot Horowitz on this issue is both cheap, weak and poor and one does not seem to care about the implications from this report.\n\n More important in this case is the human factor.\n\n Obviously several thousand adminsitrators are incompetent or incapable performing **very basic** administration tasks like\n\n \n * configuring a daemon to localhost or a private IP only\n * configuring a firewall\n \n My theory on this is that more and more untalented IT workers are in charge for dealing with technology issues, networking and programming aspects that are far beyond their horizon. This is not only a problem of MongoDB but can be also observed with other IT technology. Watching mailing lists, IRC, Stackoverflow and other related media over the last years is becoming a growing pain. The technology is getting more and more diverse and complex but the intelligence and motivation of the \"typical\" IT workers seems to go down year by year. Yes, this is a typical Andreas Jung rant but many tasks in software development and system administration should be left to people that know what they are doing. But many IT departments apparently do not care about competence, security and privacy (any more). Mistakes happen every day - even for experienced IT workers and experts. However this report with 40.000 open MongoDB installations indicates some more fundamental problems how IT security handled in organizations: badly. And my recommendation: unmotivated and untalended script kiddies should keep their fingers away from security critical infrastructure and components.\n\n   ",

There are some Javascript add-ons around for providing hyphenation support across all browsers and most common languages - solutions like [Hyphenator](https://github.com/mnater/Hyphenator).\n\n In general hyphenation on the web is not that important as hyphenation in print due to different display sizes, responsive design etc. However in some situations you want proper hyphenation for words or texts when the horizontal width of a box is limited and the standard word breaking algorithms of browser just generate a bad result.\n\n This is one of (my) issues with the Plone 5 toolbar which looks like this (out-of-the-box with German as language) with completely unacceptable and improper word breaks.\n\n ![](plone-toolbar-1/image_preview.png \"Plone Toolbar\")\n\n [zopyx.plone.hyphenator](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zopyx.plone.hyphenator) solves this problem by integrating [Hyphenator](https://github.com/mnater/Hyphenator) with Plone 5. \n\n As a result the Plone 5 toolbar looks much nicer - in particular because a proper hyphenation. \n\n ![](plone-toolbar/image_preview.png \"Plone Toolbar\")\n\n [zopyx.plone.hyphenator](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zopyx.plone.hyphenator) can be configured to apply hyphenation to arbitrary page element by specifying a list of related CSS selectors within the Hyphenator control panel\n\n ![](hyphenator-settings/image_preview.png \"Hyphenator Settings\")\n\n [Hyphenator](https://github.com/mnater/Hyphenator) supports most of the frequently used [languages](https://github.com/mnater/Hyphenator/blob/wiki/en_AddNewLanguage.md#what-we-have-now). Further hyphenation options provided by [Hyphenator](https://github.com/mnater/Hyphenator) will be supported by [zopyx.plone.hyphenator](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zopyx.plone.hyphenator) over time.\n\n  \n\n   ",

All wrapper share basically the same common API which is fully <a href=\"http://smashdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">documented</a> for Python.</p>\n\n<p>On top of the language specific SMASHDOCs wrappers we will provide CMS specific implementations like the one for Plone (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLsbx-uRdh2-0p_wOX2lont-hicsLn3QWe&amp;v=bVorpJdFmMg\">screencast</a>).</p>\n\n<p>A prototype integration of SMASHDOCs with Drupal is currently in the making (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUfjcmMo6Ok&amp;feature=em-upload_owner\">screencast</a>).</p>\n\n<p>The name of this new project is <strong>Creating Content Together. </strong>Besides the SMASHDOCs integration we will optionally provide extended publishing capabilities based on our decade-long experience with project based on the<a href=\"https://produce-and-publish.com/\"> Produce &amp; Publish</a>  stack and our <a href=\"http://xml-director.info/\">XML-Director</a> CMS solution.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.creating-content-together.info/\"><img src=\"logo_EN.png\" style=\"width:300px\" alt=\"creating content together logo\" title=\"creating content together logo\"> www.creating-content-together.info</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://content-gemeinsam-erstellen.de/\"><img src=\"logo_DE.png\" style=\"width:300px\" alt=\"content-gemeinsam-erstellen logo\" title=\"content-gemeinsam-erstellen logo\"> www.content-gemeinsam-erstellen.de</a></p>\n\n<p>Further informations about roadmap, functionality and pricing can be found on the websites above.

All wrapper share basically the same common API which is fully [documented](http://smashdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for Python.\n\n On top of the language specific SMASHDOCs wrappers we will provide CMS specific implementations like the one for Plone ([screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLsbx-uRdh2-0p_wOX2lont-hicsLn3QWe&v=bVorpJdFmMg)).\n\n A prototype integration of SMASHDOCs with Drupal is currently in the making ([screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUfjcmMo6Ok&feature=em-upload_owner)).\n\n The name of this new project is **Creating Content Together.** Besides the SMASHDOCs integration we will optionally provide extended publishing capabilities based on our decade-long experience with project based on the [Produce & Publish](https://produce-and-publish.com/) stack and our [XML-Director](http://xml-director.info/) CMS solution.\n\n [![creating content together logo](logo_EN.png \"creating content together logo\") www.creating-content-together.info](http://www.creating-content-together.info/)\n\n [![content-gemeinsam-erstellen logo](logo_DE.png \"content-gemeinsam-erstellen logo\") www.content-gemeinsam-erstellen.de](http://content-gemeinsam-erstellen.de/)\n\n Further informations about roadmap, functionality and pricing can be found on the websites above.

In particular there is no straight forward way for grouping fields in a DX schema in a two level hierarchy.</p>\n\n<p>We came to <a href=\"https://github.com/vue-generators/vue-form-generator\">Vue Form Generator</a> which allows us to implement the requirements in a pretty straight forward way. VFG is based on VueJS - yet another Javascript framework for building rich client-side user interfaces.</p>\n\n<p>My reasons for using VueJS over ReactJS or Angular: </p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>easy approachable</li>\n\t<li>no verbose code needed</li>\n\t<li>everything is brought to the point</li>\n\t<li>no steep learning curve</li>\n\t<li>easily extensible</li>\n\t<li>it fits my brain</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/vue-generators/vue-form-generator\">Vue Form Generator</a> allows us to implement forms as web compontents. All forms are defined using JSON (<a href=\"https://github.com/vue-generators/vue-form-generator/blob/master/examples/simple/main.js#L45-L113\">example</a>). In addition to the field properties used by VFG, you can add additional application specific properties. A JSON field schema definition acts as a single point of configuration both for all edit forms and all view forms (similiar to Dexterity).  The <a href=\"http://nimb.ws/x4QGt1\">screenshot</a> shows an auto-generated contact form with various address groups.</p>\n\n<p>We use minimal Dexterity based content-types for storing the form data inside an annotation. The  schemas of the content-types only define the standard Dublin Core metadata. The form data is being send from the client using an AJAX post operation to Plone.

In particular there is no straight forward way for grouping fields in a DX schema in a two level hierarchy.\n\n We came to [Vue Form Generator](https://github.com/vue-generators/vue-form-generator) which allows us to implement the requirements in a pretty straight forward way. VFG is based on VueJS - yet another Javascript framework for building rich client-side user interfaces.\n\n My reasons for using VueJS over ReactJS or Angular: \n\n \n * easy approachable\n * no verbose code needed\n * everything is brought to the point\n * no steep learning curve\n * easily extensible\n * it fits my brain\n \n [Vue Form Generator](https://github.com/vue-generators/vue-form-generator) allows us to implement forms as web compontents. All forms are defined using JSON ([example](https://github.com/vue-generators/vue-form-generator/blob/master/examples/simple/main.js#L45-L113)). In addition to the field properties used by VFG, you can add additional application specific properties. A JSON field schema definition acts as a single point of configuration both for all edit forms and all view forms (similiar to Dexterity). The [screenshot](http://nimb.ws/x4QGt1) shows an auto-generated contact form with various address groups.\n\n We use minimal Dexterity based content-types for storing the form data inside an annotation. The schemas of the content-types only define the standard Dublin Core metadata. The form data is being send from the client using an AJAX post operation to Plone. On the server we perform minimal validation like type checking and take the standard security precautions.\n\n Vue Form Generator also support some [non-standard field types](https://icebob.gitbooks.io/vueformgenerator/content/fields/optional_fields.html) that go beyond the standard HTML input fields. \n\n Lessons learned:\n\n \n * it is easy to integrate VueJS and Vue Form Generator with Plone\n * using JSON to define and manage form definitions is easy\n * no restart needed for changed form definitions\n * no support (at this time) for uploads (images, files)\n * small code base\n * no intended as a replacement for Dexterity but a straight forward solution for building more fancy user interfaces with a Dexterity backend\n \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n   ",

Plone 5.2 on top of Python 3 was first demonstrated at the Plone conference 2018 in Tokyo and it was clear that we wanted to go directly to a Python 3 directly rather  to migrate to Plone 5.2 on top of Python 2.7 first. In the first phase we had to upgrade the complete <a href=\"https://xml-director.info/\">XML Director</a> and<a href=\"https://produce-and-publish.com/\"> Produce &amp; Publish</a> stack which is the foundation of our XML based publishing solutions for many years. Fortunately the implementation of most modules have a good design and porting them to Python 3 was more about changing imports than doing any reimplementation work. The standard migration problems were related to encoding and IO issues - things which are handled different in Python 2 and Python 3. We intentionally dropped support for Python 2 rather than making the code base compatible with Python 2 and 3. Python 2 is dead and it does not make sense for our own business cases to support Python2 in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Porting the<a href=\"https://onkopedia.com/\"> onkopedia.com</a> itself to Plone 5.2 and Python 3 was almost pretty easy since it was already based on Dexterity. </p>\n\n<p>Some efforts went into the implementation of <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/xmldirector.connector/\">xmldirector.connector</a> as an updated version of <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/xmldirector.plonecore\">xmldirector.plonecore</a>. xmldirector.connector is now based on Python 3 and based on <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/fs/\">PyFilesystem 2</a> and therefore ready for future challenges.</p>\n\n<p>The responsive frontend is a complete redesign and was implemented using Diazo and Bootstrap.</p>\n\n<p>The content migration was implemented on the Plone side using our own migration process with is basically a full export/full import solution over plone.restapi which was developed over the last years as part of other Plone migration projects for our own customers.  Onkopedia used to use the  XML database <a href=\"http://exist-db.org/\">eXistDB</a> for storing all the XML related content. For technical reasons we abandoned eXistDB and moved over to a filesystem based storage. This change was painless because the <a href=\"https://onkopedia.com/\">onkopedia.com </a>application and the underlaying XML-Director implementation allowed us to abstract the storage layer and basically change the storage location by just switching the storage URL - no further code changes necessary! In the mid-future we plan to use FusionDB as storage layer for XML-based publishing solutions. <a href=\"https://fusiondb.com/\">FusionDB</a> is based on the ideas and partly on the code base of eXistDB but with a modern storage layer based on <a href=\"https://rocksdb.org/\">RocksDB</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Onkopedia contents is also available through the Onkopedia Apps ((<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/de/app/onkopedia-leitlinienportal/id1436313123\">iOS</a>, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onkopedia.app&amp;hl=en\">Android</a>). The apps are backed by the original Onkopedia content. For technical reasons we export the Onkopedia content several times a day and make them available to the apps over a small REST API. The Onkopedia apps allow the users to access the content offline which is needed e.g. in hospitals which thick walls, underground offices  with limited or no network connectivity.</p>\n\n<h3>References</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><a href=\"https://www.produce-and-publish.com/showcase/references\">Complete list of reference related to Produce &amp; Publish and XML-Director</a></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><a href=\"https://www.xml-director.info/files/Onkopedia-EN.pdf\">Onkopedia Case study - XML-based publishing with Plone, Exist-DB and XML-Director</a></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><a href=\"https://www.xml-director.info/files/Onkopedia-DE.pdf\">Onkopedia Case study - XML-based publishing with Plone, Exist-DB and XML-Director (German)</a></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Project partners</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><a href=\"https://zopyx.com/\">ZOPYX</a></p>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>backend</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>requirements engineering</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>project management</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><a href=\"https://abstract-technology.de/\">Abstract Technology</a></p>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>frontend design and implementation</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><a href=\"http://www.appweeve.com/\">Appweeve</a></p>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>Onkopedia App</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><a href=\"http://www.practice-innovation.de/\">practice innovation</a></p>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>XML workflows and DOCX conversion</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p><a href=\"https://c-rex.net/\" style=\"font-size: 12.8px;\">C-rex.net</a></p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><a href=\"https://www.ityou.de/\">IT.YOU</a></p>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>Hosting and administration</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n        </div>\n\n\n         \n    \n\n                            </div>\n                        \n\n                      \n                    ",

A DGHO employee then checks the documents for technical suitability and feeds them into the CMS, where they are converted to HTML and - for printing purposes - to PDF. \n\n ### Project goals\n\n \n *  Migration of [onkopedia.com](https://onkopedia.com/) from Plone 4.3 to Plone 5.2\n\n \n *  Port of underlaying [XML-Director](https://xml-director.info/) infrastructure to Plone 5.2 and Python 3.6/3.7\n\n \n *  Port of [Produce & Publishing](https://produce-and-publish.com/) stack to Plone 5.2 and Python 3.6/3.7\n\n \n *  Resign and reimplementation of the Onkopedia look & feel\n\n \n *  Full responsiveness\n\n \n *  All content available across all mobile devices\n\n \n *  New REST backend for Onkopedia apps ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/onkopedia-leitlinienportal/id1436313123), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onkopedia.app&hl=en))\n\n \n \n ### Screenshots\n\n [![onkopedia-new-1](IMG_2599.png \"onkopedia-new-1\")](IMG_2599.png)  [![onkopedia-new-2](IMG_2600.png \"onkopedia-new-2\")](IMG_2600.png) \n\n [![onkopedia-new-3](IMG_2601.png \"onkopedia-new-3\")](IMG_2601.png)  [![onkopedia-new-4](IMG_2602.png \"onkopedia-new-4\")](IMG_2602.png) \n\n [![onkopedia-new-5](IMG_2603.png \"onkopedia-new-5\")](IMG_2603.png)  [![onkopedia-new-6](IMG_2604.png \"onkopedia-new-6\")](IMG_2604.png) \n\n ### Project summary\n\n The migration to Plone 5.2 and Python 3 was a large step. Plone 5.2 on top of Python 3 was first demonstrated at the Plone conference 2018 in Tokyo and it was clear that we wanted to go directly to a Python 3 directly rather to migrate to Plone 5.2 on top of Python 2.7 first. In the first phase we had to upgrade the complete [XML Director](https://xml-director.info/) and [Produce & Publish](https://produce-and-publish.com/) stack which is the foundation of our XML based publishing solutions for many years. Fortunately the implementation of most modules have a good design and porting them to Python 3 was more about changing imports than doing any reimplementation work. The standard migration problems were related to encoding and IO issues - things which are handled different in Python 2 and Python 3. We intentionally dropped support for Python 2 rather than making the code base compatible with Python 2 and 3. Python 2 is dead and it does not make sense for our own business cases to support Python2 in the future.\n\n Porting the [onkopedia.com](https://onkopedia.com/) itself to Plone 5.2 and Python 3 was almost pretty easy since it was already based on Dexterity. \n\n Some efforts went into the implementation of [xmldirector.connector](https://pypi.org/project/xmldirector.connector/) as an updated version of [xmldirector.plonecore](https://pypi.org/project/xmldirector.plonecore). xmldirector.connector is now based on Python 3 and based on [PyFilesystem 2](https://pypi.org/project/fs/) and therefore ready for future challenges.\n\n The responsive frontend is a complete redesign and was implemented using Diazo and Bootstrap.\n\n The content migration was implemented on the Plone side using our own migration process with is basically a full export/full import solution over plone.restapi which was developed over the last years as part of other Plone migration projects for our own customers. Onkopedia used to use the XML database [eXistDB](http://exist-db.org/) for storing all the XML related content. For technical reasons we abandoned eXistDB and moved over to a filesystem based storage. This change was painless because the [onkopedia.com](https://onkopedia.com/) application and the underlaying XML-Director implementation allowed us to abstract the storage layer and basically change the storage location by just switching the storage URL - no further code changes necessary! In the mid-future we plan to use FusionDB as storage layer for XML-based publishing solutions. [FusionDB](https://fusiondb.com/) is based on the ideas and partly on the code base of eXistDB but with a modern storage layer based on [RocksDB](https://rocksdb.org/).\n\n The Onkopedia contents is also available through the Onkopedia Apps (([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/onkopedia-leitlinienportal/id1436313123), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onkopedia.app&hl=en)). The apps are backed by the original Onkopedia content. For technical reasons we export the Onkopedia content several times a day and make them available to the apps over a small REST API. The Onkopedia apps allow the users to access the content offline which is needed e.g. in hospitals which thick walls, underground offices with limited or no network connectivity.\n\n ### References\n\n \n *  [Complete list of reference related to Produce & Publish and XML-Director](https://www.produce-and-publish.com/showcase/references)\n\n \n *  [Onkopedia Case study - XML-based publishing with Plone, Exist-DB and XML-Director](https://www.xml-director.info/files/Onkopedia-EN.pdf)\n\n \n *  [Onkopedia Case study - XML-based publishing with Plone, Exist-DB and XML-Director (German)](https://www.xml-director.info/files/Onkopedia-DE.pdf)\n\n \n \n ### Project partners\n\n \n *  [ZOPYX](https://zopyx.com/)\n\n \n\t +  backend\n\t\n\t \n\t +  requirements engineering\n\t\n\t \n\t +  project management \n *  [Abstract Technology](https://abstract-technology.de/)\n\n \n\t +  frontend design and implementation \n *  [Appweeve](http://www.appweeve.com/)\n\n \n\t +  Onkopedia App \n *  [practice innovation](http://www.practice-innovation.de/)\n\n \n\t +  XML workflows and DOCX conversion\n\t\n\t \n\t +  [C-rex.net](https://c-rex.net/) \n *  [IT.YOU](https://www.ityou.de/)\n\n \n\t +  Hosting and administration \n \n   ",
